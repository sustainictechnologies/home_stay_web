            JALAD is India's slow-travel community network — a directory of verified rural stays connecting
            conscious travelers directly with local families across mountains, forests, coastlines, deserts,
            and culturally rich villages. We exist to keep tourism money inside the communities that make
            India worth exploring.

      <section className="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 py-20">
        <div className="prose prose-stone max-w-none text-stone-600 leading-relaxed space-y-5">
          <p>
            JALAD didn't start as a business plan; it started as a realization that modern tourism is leaving
            the most genuine people behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            While traveling, we noticed a painful divide: major booking platforms are crowded with commercialized,
            hotel-style spaces optimized by algorithms. Meanwhile, the real families — the ones living deep in
            jungles, remote mountain tracks, or isolated rural villages — remain completely invisible. These are
            families who offer unmatched, deeply loving hospitality but cannot navigate the internet, manage
            digital dashboards, or afford online marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built JALAD to act as their bridge to the conscious world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to connect urban travelers directly with hosts who live a simple life. When you stay
            here, you are not buying a curated luxury package. You might sleep in a single rustic room or pitch
            a tent in a host's backyard. You won't get a designed menu; you will share whatever wholesome,
            region-specific meal the family is eating that day.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an economy of empathy — a pure give-and-take opportunity to share thoughts, respect
            lifestyles, and become family. Because we believe in true community empowerment, JALAD charges
            zero fees to travelers and takes zero commission from hosts. <strong>100% of your money goes
            straight into the hands of families who preserve our lands and traditions</strong>, creating an
            equal ground where city and village meet.
